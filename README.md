# PowerBI Adventure-Works-Analytics

### 1. **Objective**

The purpose of this analysis is to equip stakeholders with a detailed understanding of:

Sales volume and profitability trends over time

Product category performance and operational efficiency

Customer behavior by segment, geography, and market

Return rates and shipping performance impacts on profit

The ultimate goal is to translate this performance data into strategic priorities to boost profit margins, reduce operational costs, and optimize market targeting.


### 2. **Sales Overview**

Total Sales: $12.64M

Total Profit: $1.00M

Profit Margin: 7.9%

Total Orders: 25K

Sales Growth YoY: 52%

Total Units Sold: 178K

**Key Observations:**
Sales grew rapidly between 2011–2014, with notable spikes in Q2 2013 and Q3 2014.

Standard Class shipping dominates with $3.9M in sales, but this could indicate potential over-reliance and rising logistics costs.

The Consumer segment generates over $6.5M, accounting for 51.5% of sales volume. Corporate and Home Office follow at 30.2% and 18.3% respectively.

The US, APAC, LATAM, and EU markets lead in order volume, each contributing over 4.5K orders, showing global market penetration.

**Decision Point:**
While sales growth is encouraging, a low profit margin (7.9%) despite high volume signals rising fulfillment costs, discount pressure, or return impact. This needs root-cause analysis.



### 3. **Product & Profitability Analysis**

Product Volume:
Top 3 Sub-Categories by Orders:

Binders: 5.4K orders

Storage: 4.5K

Art Supplies: 4.4K
These are high-volume but low-margin categories.

**Profitability by Category:**
Category	Profit Contribution
Technology	Strongest performer (e.g., Copiers +$259K, Phones +$217K)
Furniture	Moderate ($140K from Chairs), but high return rates
Office Supplies	Low profit despite high sales volume

**Profitability Gaps:**
Machines, Furnishings, and several Office Supplies have high sales but negligible or negative profit, possibly due to steep discounts or returns.

The top 10 products account for a significant portion of orders, yet many have below-average profit margins.

**Decision Point:**
Shift inventory and sales strategies toward profitable sub-categories like Copiers & Phones, and reprice or replace underperforming SKUs.



### 4. **Customer Analysis**

Customer Base Overview:
Total Orders by Segment:

Consumer: 6.5M

Corporate: 3.8M

Home Office: 2.3M

Top Markets by Order Volume:

APAC (5.4K), LATAM (5.1K), US (5.0K), EU (4.6K)

**Key Patterns:**
Consumer segment is highly active but contributes relatively less profit—suggesting high sales volumes, small basket sizes, and higher return rates.

LATAM and Canada exhibit higher average order values, indicating high-value customers, possibly in B2B transactions.

Customer distribution is relatively even across APAC, LATAM, US, and EU, which reduces market dependency.

**Decision Point:**
Launch customer tiering & loyalty programs focusing on high-order-value regions (e.g., LATAM, Canada), and reassess marketing ROI in low-margin customer segments.



### 5. **Returns & Shipping Analysis**

Return Metrics:
Overall Return Rate: 29% of orders

By Category:

Furniture: 40.1% (critical)

Technology: 30%

Office Supplies: 29.8%

By Segment:

Consumer: 29.8%

Corporate: 28.7%

Home Office: 28.6%

**Shipping Insights:**
Average Shipping Time: 3.97 days

By Segment:

Corporate orders ship fastest (~3.5 days)

Consumer orders take slightly longer (~4+ days)

By Category:

Furniture ships slowest (often >4 days), contributing to dissatisfaction and returns

**Decision Point:**
High return rates in Furniture and long shipping delays indicate a logistics and product fit issue. Returns are likely eroding profit margin.


### 6. **Key Insights**

Strong sales growth has not translated into strong profitability — a sign of underlying cost inefficiencies.

Consumer segment dominates order count but is associated with higher returns and lower margins.

Furniture is a top return driver, possibly due to slow shipping, product size, or quality issues.

Technology, specifically Copiers and Phones, are high-margin performers — and deserve prioritization.

LATAM and Canada show high order values and could be targeted for premium services or upselling.


### 7. **Strategic Recommendations**
**A. Margin Optimization**
Review and reduce discounting policies on low-margin items

Introduce minimum shipping fee thresholds for low-profit orders

Reassess supplier contracts or renegotiate terms for high-cost product lines

**B. Returns Reduction Strategy**
Launch a "Furniture Fit & Delivery Assurance" program to reduce returns

Use predictive analytics to flag high-return products or customers

Offer incentives for non-returnable purchases or virtual try-outs

**C. Targeted Market Growth**
Invest in marketing automation and segmentation for LATAM and Canada

Introduce premium membership or loyalty tiers for repeat high-value customers

**D. Operational Efficiency**
Improve supply chain for Furniture & Office Supplies categories to shorten shipping time

Consolidate shipping modes (optimize away from low-volume “Same Day” usage)

**E. Data-Driven Category Strategy**
De-emphasize low-margin products with high handling costs

Focus sales efforts and training on high-profit categories like Copiers and Tech
