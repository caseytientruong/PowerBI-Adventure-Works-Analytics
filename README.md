## 5. Key Insights

Revenue Concentration: A significant portion of revenue is concentrated in the Consumer segment and top-performing regions like North America and APAC.

High Profitability Products: Technology leads both in terms of revenue and margins; phones and copiers are top drivers.

Churn Volatility: High churn in certain months like August and October suggests post-promotional fallout or poor customer experience.

Market Expansion Opportunity: Underperforming markets like Africa and Canada represent low-hanging fruit for targeted campaigns.

Shipping Efficiency: Standard Class is the preferred shipping mode, indicating it should remain default unless customer preferences change.

Customer Segmentation Maturity: The company demonstrates strong returning customer engagement, but needs more aggressive strategies for new customer acquisition.

APAC, LATAM, and EMEA contribute significantly to high-volume returns. Despite strong sales volumes, these regions experience disproportionate returns, affecting profitability and customer trust.

Return spikes align with high sales months and promotional periods (holidays, Q4). This is likely due to impulse purchases, gift returns, or unmet expectations.

Technologyâ€™s high return rate may indicate issues with functionality, delivery damage, or product expectations.

Office Supplies return rate is slightly higher in Corporate environments, suggesting bulk purchases and administrative errors.

Furniture items like Chairs and Phones likely face fit, comfort, or damage issues.

Binders may suffer from low-cost quality perception or bulk order mistakes.
